  Supports vi style keybindings (hjkl), cursor keys and the mouse. 
  Press J to 'join' a well-suited pile to the cursor. Space locks 
  in a selection, and Return pulls cards from the stack in spider 
  solitaire. Piles can also be directly addressed by the number 
  below them (or 8, 9, 0 for stack, waste and foundation in klondike).
  See $PROGNAME -h for details.
